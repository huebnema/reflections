When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository to be able to share with other people or computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You would want to pull changes manually so that you can make sure that you aren't pulling code from the GitHub repository that would interfere with what you are working on locally.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork - copies someone else's repository and allows you to modify it, it doesn't make changes to their repository
Clone - copies your repository on your computer or between your computer and GitHub
Branch - copies a commit and allows you to make changes to it without impacting the master or another branch

master - local version
origin/master - local version of the remote repository (can be downloaded at any time)

git pull origin master = git fetch origin + git merge master origin/master
(a pull combines both a merge and a fetch while a fetch creates a local copy of the current state of the remote repository)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of having a locally storied version of the remote is if you don't have internet access or want to compare your working file with the remote version.
